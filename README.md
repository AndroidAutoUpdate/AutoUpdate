# AutoUpdate
The replication package is created for the paper titled "AutoUpdate: Automatically Recommend Code Updates for Android Apps"
## Overview

## Description

## Dataset 
Since there is no publicly-available datasets of code updates for Android apps, we construct a new dataset to evaluate the performance of automatically recommending code updates for Android apps.  We collect 209,346 pairs of updated methods from 3,195 open-source Android applications. 

The datasets are publicly available at Zenodo [Link](https://zenodo.org/record/6538487).
